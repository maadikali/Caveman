# Caveman Game

**Caveman** is a 2D platformer game developed using **C++** and the **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). It features a cave-themed environment where players control the main character to navigate obstacles and challenges. This project demonstrates foundational game development skills, including character animation, collision detection, and map design.

## Features
- Developed using **SFML**, a multimedia library.
- Maps designed with **Tiled**, a 2D level editor.
- Smooth character mechanics with animations, physics, and collision detection.
- Lightweight and efficient, with minimal hardware requirements.

## Development
The game was created to emphasize:
- Learning SFML and Tiled from scratch.
- Implementing core game mechanics and basic level transitions.

## Limitations
- Limited levels and gameplay duration.
- Simplistic map creation; enhancements are planned for future updates.

## Future Improvements
- Adding more levels with varying difficulty.
- Enhancing map design with layered structures for a more professional touch.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Game Library**: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **Level Design Tool**: Tiled
